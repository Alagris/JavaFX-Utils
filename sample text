Perfect government 

Every country is like an organism. It lives, grows, makes decisions. In XXI century humanity starts to truly understand how our 
brains work. Why not to apply this knowledge to really big scale? 

Imagine that every single person works like a neuron. They can vote as if they fired action potential. 1 means "yes", -1 means
"no" and all values between mean something intermediate, including 0 which means "I have no idea". Whenever a problem emerges
everyone WHO is directly influenced by the decision can have a voice in making it. That's why the society needs to be divided
into some sectors. Like in a database. We could query for a certain group of people by specifying desired attibutes. Is it
decision about health care? - let's ask doctors! Is it decision about building a new road? - let's ask citizents who live 
nearby. 

Okay but how do these problems emerge? It's not only about issues. People can also vote for new ideas or modifying the old ones.
Well, when citizens think that something is worth consideration, they may rise a proposal to the whole nation. This is
the first stage of voting. Everyone who is interested can point a group of people, who should, in their opinion, be allowed to 
vote. They, however, cannot point themselves. If enough* people show interest, the system counts votes and finally selects two groups
of people - those who were most frequently pointed and also those who most frequently pointed others*.
